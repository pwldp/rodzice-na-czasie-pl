This can be very useful when debugging your app.\n\nThe SocketStream console follows the client/server model. This ensures the console client starts instantly and even allows you to run commands against a live production system, should you wish.\n\n**Important Note** The latest release of ss-console (0.1.3) is designed to work with Node 0.8 only. If you are using Node 0.6 please install version 0.1.2 from npm.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nAdd `ss-console` to your package.json then add the following lines to your `app.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nvar consoleServer = require('ss-console')(ss);\nconsoleServer.listen(5000);\n```\n\nChange `5000` to another number if you wish to listen on another port.\n\n\n### Connecting to a server\n\nInstall the client globally with:\n\n    $ sudo npm install -g ss-console\n\nOnce your server is listening out for incoming console connections, connect to it from the terminal by executing:\n\n    $ ss-console\n\nBy default `ss-console` will try to connect to a SocketStream server on localhost, port 5000. To connect to another host and/or port, pass params as so:\n\n    $ ss-console www.mysocketstreamserver.com 8500\n\nNote: A new Session ID will be created for you each time you connect to the console, allowing you to call `ss.rpc()` commands which use the `req.use('session')` middleware.\n",
