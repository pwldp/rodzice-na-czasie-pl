# fakeredis - a fake redis for node.js


This module provides easy-to-use simulated instances of Redis
to which you appear to be connected via the pretty much standard
[redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) client by [Matt Ranney](https://github.com/mranney).
**It helps with writing tests** in two ways:
your tests won't require an actual redis instance
and you'll be able to safely run as many tests in parallel as you want.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hdachev/fakeredis.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hdachev/fakeredis)


## Usage

Install:

    npm install fakeredis

You can use fakeredis as you would use node_redis,
just changing the module name from `redis` to `fakeredis`:

```javascript
var client = require ( "fakeredis" )
    .createClient ( port, host );
```

Both parameters are optional,
and only serve to determine if you want to reuse a an existing fakeredis instance or not:

```javascript
var redis  = require ( "fakeredis" );

    ////    Create a connection to a fresh fakeredis instance:

var client = redis.createClient ( "social stuff" );

    ////    Connect to the same backend via another simulated connection:

var concurrentClient = redis.createClient ( "social stuff" );
```

By omitting both parameters,
you simply create a new blank slate fakeredis instance:

```javascript
var client = require ( "fakeredis" )
    .createClient ();
```


In other words,
every time you create a client specifying the same port and/or name
you reuse the same simulated backend.
This makes most sense when you need a concurrent client setup for some test,
say because you need to publish / subscribe,
or because you want to test something that's based on `MULTI`/`EXEC`
and uses optimistic locking with `WATCH`/`UNWATCH`.

In any case, fakeredis shines over the real thing for testing
because you can run as many tests in parallel as you wish,
and that's why you'll generally be naming your clients
in a way that ensures they don't collide between tests.



## Intended differences from a true Redis

One key difference is that the output of some commands,
such as `SMEMBERS`, `HKEYS`, `HVALS`,
comes out sorted lexicographically to provide for simpler testing.
This means that some tests that make use of undocumented Redis behaviours
such as the chronological order of retrieval for members in a set
may fail when attempted with fakeredis.
To solve this,
whenever there is no documented sort order for a given Redis command's multi-bulk reply,
sort the output before asserting equality to ensure your tests run everywhere.

Another major difference is that commands that accept modifier parameters, such as
`SORT key [BY pattern] [LIMIT offset count] [GET pattern [GET pattern ...]] [ASC|DESC] [ALPHA] [STORE destination]`
currently only accept these parameters in the order that is stated in the documentation.
For example,
in Redis it appears to be perfectly legitimate to have `SORT myset ALPHA LIMIT 0 5`,
but in fakeredis this will currently return a syntax error.

I'm totally open to discussion on both points.



### Implemented subset:

All string, list, hash, set and sorted set commands,
most keyspace commands, and some connection and server commands.
Pubsub, transactions with optimistic locking are also fully implemented.

Transactions:

    DISCARD
    EXEC
    MULTI
    UNWATCH
    WATCH

Connection and Server:

    ECHO
    PING
    QUIT

These do nothing but return `OK`:

    AUTH
    BGREWRITEAOF
    BGSAVE
    SAVE


### What's missing:

Most notably, `MONITOR` is still missing.

Also note that **none of the node_redis client constructor options are available**,
which means no `detect_buffers` and `return_buffers`.
Command arguments are always stringified at the fake connection level,
and replies are always returned as `null`, `String`, `Number` or `Array`.

Finally,
none of the `ready`, `connect`, `error`, `end`, `drain` and `idle`
client events are currently implemented.

List of **missing** commands (will throw upon attempt to use):

Connection and Server:

    CONFIG GET
    CONFIG SET
    CONFIG RESETSTAT
    DEBUG OBJECT
    DEBUG SEGFAULT
    FLUSHALL
    INFO
    LASTSAVE
    MONITOR
    MOVE
    OBJECT
    SELECT
    SHUTDOWN
    SLAVEOF
    SYNC



## Helpers

To facilitate development and testing,
fakeredis provides some additional methods on the client object.


### Prettyprinting:

```javascript
fakeredisClient.pretty ();
fakeredisClient.pretty ( "p*tte?n" );
fakeredisClient.pretty ( options );
```

`.pretty()` will prettyprint to stdout the entire keyspace
or a subset of keys specificed with a redis pattern
of the same kind that's used for `KEYS` and `PSUBSCRIBE`.
Keep in mind .pretty() is async,
because it works as a normal client command
and hence needs to respect the command order,
fake pipelining and latency and all,
so that you can do stuff like:

```javascript
var fake   = require ( "fakeredis" );
var client = fake.createClient ();

client.SADD ( 'hello', 'world', 'Jenny', 'Sam' );
client.LPUSH ( 'mylist', 'hey', 'ho', 'letsgo' );
client.pretty ({ label : "my stuff", pattern : "*" });
```

Which would print *(in color!)*

    my stuff:

    set     hello
    -1      Jenny,  Sam,    world

    list    mylist
    -1      letsgo, ho,     hey


### Keyspace dumps:

```javascript
fakeredisClient.getKeypsace ( callback );
fakeredisClient.getKeypsace ( "p*tte?n", callback );
fakeredisClient.getKeyspace ( options, callback );
```

Will callback ( err, data ) with an array
that enumerates the whole keyspace,
or the requested subset, in the following manner:

```javascript
[
    key1, ttl1, type1, value1,
    key2, ttl2, type2, value2,
    ...
]
```

The keyspace is sorted lexicographically by key,
string values are strings,
list values are the output of `LRANGE 0 -1`,
hashes come out as the output of `HGETALL` for hashes
(no syntactic sugar though, so an Array of `[ field, value, field, value, ... ]`),
`SMEMBERS` output is used for sets,
and `ZRANGE 0 -1 WITHSCORES` for sorted sets,
each of which is sorted lexicographically in a way that makes sense,
so that the final result is simple enough to assert deep equality against.

In any case, you'll probably need to reformat these keyspace dumps
to a format that makes more sense for your testing needs.
There are a couple of transforms that are included out of the box:

```javascript
fakeredisClient.getKeypsace ({ pattern : "myz*", map : true }, callback );
```

If you only care about the key and value of each entry,
you can set the **map** option to a truthy value,
you will instead receive the keyspace dump as a key-value map of the kind:

```javascript
{
    key1 : value1,
    key2 : value2,
    ...
}
```

This means you're skipping ttl and key type info though. You can also do:

```javascript
fakeredisClient.getKeypsace ({ pattern : "myz*", group : true }, callback );
```

Which will return an `Array` of `Array`s,
one for each keyspace entry, so that you end up with:

```javascript
[
    [ key1, ttl1, type1, value1 ],
    [ key2, ttl2, type2, value2 ],
    ...
]
```

The benefit of this option is that you can sort the outer array as you like more easily.



## [Vows](http://vowsjs.org/) example

```javascript
var vows = require ( 'vows' ),
    assert = require ( 'assert' ),
    fakeredis = require ( 'fakeredis' );

vows.describe ( "fakeredis" ).addBatch
({
    "commands" :
    {
        topic : function ()
        {
            var client = fakeredis.createClient ();
                client.SET ( 'hello', 'world' );
                client.GET ( 'hello', this.callback );
        },

        "execute in the right order" : function ( err, data )
        {
            assert.equal ( data, 'world' );
        }
    },

    "set and sadd" :
    {
        topic : function ()
        {
            var client = fakeredis.createClient ();
                client.SET ( 'hello', 'redis' );
                client.SADD ( 'myset', 'one', 'two', 'three' );
                client.getKeyspace ( { map : true }, this.callback );
        },

        "generate the correct keyspace" : function ( err, data )
        {
            assert.deepEqual
            (
                data,
                {
                    // this test runs on a different fakeredis instance,
                    // so you're not risking namespace collisions between tests
                    hello : 'redis',

                    // notice set elements come out sorted
                    myset : [ 'one', 'three', 'two' ]
                }
            );
        }
    }
})
.export ( module );
```
