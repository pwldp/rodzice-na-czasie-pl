  "readme": "# SockJS Websocket Transport for SocketStream\n\nThis is an alpha release of the SockJS websocket transport for SocketStream 0.3 RC2 and above. When added to your project it acts as a complete replacement for Socket.IO (which will not be loaded or sent to the client).\n\nYou can read more about the benefits of SockJS here:\n\nhttps://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node (server)\nhttps://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client (client)\n\n\n### Installation\n\nTo use SockJS in your app, first add the `ss-sockjs` module to your `package.json`, then include the following line of code in your `app.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nss.ws.transport.use(require('ss-sockjs'));\n```\n\nThat's it! The necessary client-side code will automatically be sent to the browser and you don't need to change a line of your application code.\n\n\n### Configuring\n\nOptions can be passed directly to the `server` or `client` SockJS library. For example, to override the default `log` function on the server and turn on debugging in the client use:\n\n```javascript\nss.ws.transport.use(require('ss-sockjs'), {\n  client: {\n    debug: true\n  },\n  server: {\n    log: function(severity, message){\n      console.log('Custom logger >>>', severity, message);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n### Known issues\n\n1. This is the very first release - expect some issues\n2. SockJS does not handle reconnection as well as Socket.IO. This will be investigated and improved in future\n\nPull requests welcome!",
